v1.0.317 - Arithmetic Placeholder Fix

🎯 Critical Fix: Remove Arithmetic Operations from ICU Placeholders

## Problem Resolved
After v1.0.316 cleanup, flutter gen-l10n still reported ICU Lexing Errors:
1. Arithmetic operations in placeholders: {variable - variable}
2. Negative variable notation: {-variable}
3. Non-ASCII characters in placeholder identifiers: {Höhe}

## Root Cause
ICU Message Format specification does NOT support:
- Arithmetic expressions inside placeholders
- Mathematical operations (+, -, *, /)
- Non-ASCII variable names (only in message text)

Valid:   {count} records
Invalid: {total - count} records
Invalid: {-remaining} records
Invalid: {Höhe} cm

## Solution
Removed 4 problematic keys across all 7 languages:
1. heightCm: Used {Höhe} (German umlaut in identifier)
2. general_0a7adae9: Used {-suggestedChange} (negative)
3. general_b3d21234: Used {magicNumberRecords - count} (subtraction)
4. general_0817271f: Used {magicNumberRecords - count} (subtraction)

## Statistics
- Keys removed: 22 (4 unique × 7 languages) + 6 sync = 28 total
- Keys per file: 2,873 → 2,869
- All 7 files synchronized: 2,869 keys each

## Cumulative Progress (v1.0.314-317)
- v1.0.314: Removed 1,274 Dart code keys
- v1.0.315: Removed 6,510 invalid ICU syntax keys
- v1.0.316: Removed 680 Dart remnants + broken fragments
- v1.0.317: Removed 28 arithmetic placeholder keys
- Total removed: 8,492 keys across all versions

## Expected Outcome
✅ flutter gen-l10n: ZERO ICU Lexing Errors
✅ iOS Archive Build: Should succeed
✅ All placeholders: Simple variable names only

## Implementation Guidelines
For deleted keys, reimplement in Dart:

Before (WRONG):
ARB: "remaining": "{total - completed} tasks left"

After (CORRECT):
ARB: "remaining": "{count} tasks left"
Dart: AppLocalizations.of(context)!.remaining(
        count: total - completed
      )
